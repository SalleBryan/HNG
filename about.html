                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Salle Bryan, a frontend developer with a passion for creating accessible and
                    delightful user
                    experiences.
                    My journey into web development started with a curiosity about how websites work, which
                    quickly evolved
                    into a deep appreciation for languages like HTML, CSS, JS and libraries like React and
                    Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, I've learned that the best interfaces are those that work for everyone,
                    regardless of
                    their abilities or the devices they use. This philosophy drives my work and inspires me
                    to
                    continuously
                    improve my craft.
                </p>

                <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
                <p>
                    Remember that every line of code you write has the potential to make someone's day betterâ€”or
                    worse.
                    Choose accessibility, choose clarity, and choose empathy. The web is for everyone, and your work
                    should reflect that. Keep learning, stay curious, and never stop advocating for users who might
                    not
                    have a voice in the room. You've got this!
                </p>

            <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
                <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Accessibility isn't just an extra feature, it's an essential part of good design.
                    As I keep learning and growing in web development, I'm dedicated to promoting inclusive
                    practices and making sure my work helps create a better digital world.
                    Everyone deserves an easy and enjoyable experience, and I aim to make that happen through
                    careful design and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also think it's important to take breaks and recharge. Whether it's gaming with friends,
                    watching movies, or just stepping away from the screen, these moments of rest
                    make me a better developer and a happier person.
                </p>
