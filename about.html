                            <p>
                                I'm Salle Bryan, a frontend developer with a passion for creating accessible and
                                delightful user
                                experiences.
                                My journey into web development started with a curiosity about how websites work, which
                                quickly evolved
                                into a deep appreciation for languages like HTML, CSS, JS and libraries like React and
                                Bootstrap.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over the years, I've learned that the best interfaces are those that work for everyone,
                                regardless of
                                their abilities or the devices they use. This philosophy drives my work and inspires me
                                to
                                continuously
                                improve my craft.

                        Remember that every line of code you write has the potential to make someone's day betterâ€”or
                        worse.
                        Choose accessibility, choose clarity, and choose empathy. The web is for everyone, and your work
                        should reflect that. Keep learning, stay curious, and never stop advocating for users who might
                        not
                        have a voice in the room. You've got this!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Accessibility isn't just an extra feature, it's an essential part of good design.
                        As I keep learning and growing in web development, I'm dedicated to promoting inclusive
                        practices and making sure my work helps create a better digital world.
                        Everyone deserves an easy and enjoyable experience, and I aim to make that happen through
                        careful design and development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also think it's important to take breaks and recharge. Whether it's gaming with friends,
                        watching movies, or just stepping away from the screen, these moments of rest
                        make me a better developer and a happier person.
